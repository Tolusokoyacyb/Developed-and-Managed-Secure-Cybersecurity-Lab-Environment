# Developed and Managed Secure Cybersecurity Lab Environment

## Goal of Project

Simulate Real-World Cybersecurity Scenarios: By using Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and VirtualBox, the project aimed to replicate a real-world network environment for testing and learning various cybersecurity techniques.

Enhance Network Security: Through configuring firewalls (using UFW and nmap), the project focused on securing networks by implementing access rules, monitoring traffic, and blocking potential threats.

Improve Network Traffic Analysis Skills: By utilizing tools like Wireshark, the project sought to enhance skills in advanced network traffic analysis, identifying anomalies, troubleshooting network issues, and analyzing protocols like TCP/IP, DNS, and HTTP for better security and performance optimization.
